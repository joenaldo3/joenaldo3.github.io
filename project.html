        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>There are many competitors for productivity applications. Each app provides their own take on creating and saving content, while keeping everything accessible across multiple devices. Despite all these variations, <b>organization is still a huge issue</b>. Large amounts of content with different file types can cause busy dashboards with the <b>inability to effectively sort what is important</b>, especially on different devices/viewports. When saving content on different devices, there can be <b>frustration in where the content is saved and located.</b>
        </p>
        <img src="images/check-icon.svg" alt="Check Icon"/>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>BentoBin allows you to <b>save anything from anywhere, in one place.</b> Organization is effortless with BentoBin’s intuitive dashboard. BentoBin organizes files in “bins” and categorizes files by type (image, note, link).

        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>The project started with vague business requirements that had me frustrated in what direction to take. The cloud-storage marketplace is somewhat over saturated with apps that have great designs with a lot of functionality. But despite the over saturation, cloud-storage users still need better solutions to solve cloud-storage problems such as making organization better, or allowing the user to add content faster. I would have never found these problems if it weren't for user research and multiple user testing. Based off of these problems, I focused on improving content organization and minimizing dashboard clutter.
        </p>
        <p>If given more time, I would continue designing important functions such as search and sharing capabilities. I would expand the use of this app from “casual users” to “professional users” who use cloud-storage for corporate needs. This would require more user research and testing by corporate users, as well as upper management.
        </p>
        <p>All-in-all, I learned that applying the research-driven design process to the problem will achieve an effective solution.
